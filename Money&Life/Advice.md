[Drunk Post: Things I've learned as a Sr Engineer 原帖地址](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/)

1. 职业发展的最好方法是换公司。
2. 技术栈不重要。技术领域有大约 10-20 条核心原则，重要的是这些原则，技术栈只是落实它们的方法。你如果不熟悉某个技术栈，不需要过度担心。
3. 工作和人际关系是两回事。有一些公司，我交到了好朋友，但是工作得并不开心；另一些公司，我没有与任何同事建立友谊，但是工作得很开心。
4. 我总是对经理实话实说。怕什么？他开除我？我会在两周内找到一份新工作。
5. 如果一家公司的工程师超过 100 人，它的期权可能在未来十年内变得很有价值。对于工程师人数很少的公司，期权一般都是毫无价值。
6. 好的代码是初级工程师可以理解的代码。伟大的代码可以被第一年的 CS 专业的新生理解。
7. 作为一名工程师，最被低估的技能是记录。说真的，如果有人可以教我怎么写文档，我会付钱，也许是 1000 美元。
8. 网上的口水战，几乎都无关紧要，别去参与。
9. 如果我发现自己是公司里面最厉害的工程师，那就该离开了。
10. 我们应该雇佣更多的实习生，他们很棒。那些精力充沛的小家伙用他们的想法乱搞。如果他们公开质疑或批评某事，那就更好了。我喜欢实习生。
11. 技术栈很重要。如果你使用 Python 或 C++ 语言，就会忍不住想做一些非常不同的事情。因为某些工具确实擅长某些工作。
12. 如果你不确定自己想做什么东西，请使用 Java。这是一种糟糕的编程语言，但几乎无所不能。
13. 对于初学者来说，最赚钱的编程语言是 SQL，干翻所有其他语言。你只了解 SQL 而不会做其他事情，照样赚钱。人力资源专家的年薪？也许5万美元。懂 SQL 的人力资源专家？9万美元。
14. 测试很重要，但 TDD （测试驱动的开发）几乎变成了一个邪教。
15. 政府单位很轻松，但并不像人们说的那样好。对于职业生涯早期到中期的工程师，12 万美元的年薪 + 各种福利 + 养老金听起来不错，但是你将被禁锢在深奥的专用工具里面，离开政府单位以后，这些知识就没用了。我非常尊重政府工作人员，但说真的，这些地方的工程师，年龄中位数在 50 岁以上是有原因的。
16. 再倒一杯酒。
17. 大多数头衔都无关紧要，随便什么公司都可以有首席工程师。
18. 手腕和背部的健康问题可不是开玩笑的，好的设备值得花钱。
19. 当一个软件工程师，最好的事情是什么？你可以结识很多想法相同的人，大家互相交流，不一定有相同的兴趣，但是对方会用跟你相同的方式思考问题，这很酷。
20. 有些技术太流行，我不得不用它。我心里就会很讨厌这种技术，但会把它推荐给客户，比如我恨 Jenkins，但把它推荐给新客户，我不觉得做错了。
21. 成为一名优秀的工程师意味着了解最佳实践，成为高级工程师意味着知道何时打破最佳实践。
22. 发生事故时，如果周围的人试图将责任归咎于外部错误或底层服务中断，那么是时候离开这家公司，继续前进了。
23. 我遇到的最好的领导，同意我的一部分观点，同时耐心跟我解释，为什么不同意我的另一部分观点。我正在努力成为像他们一样的人。
24. 算法和数据结构确实重要，但不应该无限夸大，尤其是面试的时候。我没见过药剂师面试时，还要测试有机化学的细节。这个行业的面试过程有时候很糟糕。
25. 做自己喜欢的事情并不重要，不要让我做讨厌的事情更重要。It's not important to do what I like. It's more important to do what I don't hate.
26. 越接近产品，就越接近推动收入增长。无论工作的技术性如何，只要它接近产品，我都感到越有价值。
27. 即使我平时用 Windows 工作，Linux 也很重要。为什么？因为服务器是 Linux 系统，你最终在 Linux 系统上工作。
28. 人死了以后，你想让代码成为你的遗产吗？如果是那样，就花很多时间在代码上面吧，因为那是你的遗产。但是，如果你像我一样，更看重与家人、朋友和生活中其他人相处的时光，而不是写的代码，那就别对它太在意。
29. 我挣的钱还不错，对此心存感激，但还是需要省钱。
30. 糟糕，我没酒了。

I'm drunk and I'll probably regret this, but here's a drunken rank of things I've learned as an engineer for the past 10 years.

- The best way I've advanced my career is by changing companies.
- Technology stacks don't really matter because there are like 15 basic patterns of software engineering in my field that apply. I work in data so it's not going to be the same as webdev or embedded. But all fields have about 10-20 core principles and the tech stack is just trying to make those things easier, so don't fret overit.
- There's a reason why people recommend job hunting. If I'm unsatisfied at a job, it's probably time to move on.
- I've made some good, lifelong friends at companies I've worked with. I don't need to make that a requirement of every place I work. I've been perfectly happy working at places where I didn't form friendships with my coworkers and I've been unhappy at places where I made some great friends.
- I've learned to be honest with my manager. Not too honest, but honest enough where I can be authentic at work. What's the worse that can happen? He fire me? I'll just pick up a new job in 2 weeks.
- If I'm awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.
- pour another glass
- Qualities of a good manager share a lot of qualities of a good engineer.
- When I first started, I was enamored with technology and programming and computer science. I'm over it.
- Good code is code that can be understood by a junior engineer. Great code can be understood by a first year CS freshman. The best code is no code at all.
- The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document. Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation. Seriously, if there's any recommendations, I'd seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)
- Related to above, writing good proposals for changes is a great skill.
- Almost every holy war out there (vim vs emacs, mac vs linux, whatever) doesn't matter... except one. See below.
- The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. Fuck, I said it. Fight me.
- If I ever find myself thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, it's time to leave.
- I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly. No really, they should be paid like half a mil a year just base salary. Fuck they have to understand both front end AND back end AND how different browsers work AND networking AND databases AND caching AND differences between web and mobile AND omg what the fuck there's another framework out there that companies want to use? Seriously, why are webdevs paid so little.
- We should hire more interns, they're awesome. Those energetic little fucks with their ideas. Even better when they can question or criticize something. I love interns.
- sip
- Don't meet your heroes. I paid 5k to take a course by one of my heroes. He's a brilliant man, but at the end of it I realized that he's making it up as he goes along like the rest of us.
- Tech stack matters. OK I just said tech stack doesn't matter, but hear me out. If you hear Python dev vs C++ dev, you think very different things, right? That's because certain tools are really good at certain jobs. If you're not sure what you want to do, just do Java. It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.
- The greatest programming language ever is lisp. I should learn lisp.
- For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL. Fuck all other languages. If you know SQL and nothing else, you can make bank. Payroll specialtist? Maybe 50k. Payroll specialist who knows SQL? 90k. Average joe with organizational skills at big corp? $40k. Average joe with organization skills AND sql? Call yourself a PM and earn $150k.
- Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.
- Cushy government jobs are not what they are cracked up to be, at least for early to mid-career engineers. Sure, $120k + bennies + pension sound great, but you'll be selling your soul to work on esoteric proprietary technology. Much respect to government workers but seriously there's a reason why the median age for engineers at those places is 50+. Advice does not apply to government contractors.
- Third party recruiters are leeches. However, if you find a good one, seriously develop a good relationship with them. They can help bootstrap your career. How do you know if you have a good one? If they've been a third party recruiter for more than 3 years, they're probably bad. The good ones typically become recruiters are large companies.
- Options are worthless or can make you a millionaire. They're probably worthless unless the headcount of engineering is more than 100. Then maybe they are worth something within this decade.
- Work from home is the tits. But lack of whiteboarding sucks.
- I've never worked at FAANG so I don't know what I'm missing. But I've hired (and not hired) engineers from FAANGs and they don't know what they're doing either.
- My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation. Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.
- Managers have less power than you think. Way less power. If you ever thing, why doesn't Manager XYZ fire somebody, it's because they can't.
- Titles mostly don't matter. Principal Distinguished Staff Lead Engineer from Whatever Company, whatever. What did you do and what did you accomplish. That's all people care about.
- Speaking of titles: early in your career, title changes up are nice. Junior to Mid. Mid to Senior. Senior to Lead. Later in your career, title changes down are nice. That way, you can get the same compensation but then get an increase when you're promoted. In other words, early in your career (<10 years), title changes UP are good because it lets you grow your skills and responsibilities. Later, title changes down are nice because it lets you grow your salary.
- Max out our 401ks.
- Be kind to everyone. Not because it'll help your career (it will), but because being kind is rewarding by itself.
- If I didn't learn something from the junior engineer or intern this past month, I wasn't paying attention.
- Oops I'm out of wine.
- Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it. I've done a few conferences, a few 1.5k courses, many books, and a subscription. Worth it. This way, I can better pretend what I'm doing.
- Seriously, why aren't webdevs paid more? They know everything!!!
- Carpal tunnel and back problems are no joke. Spend the 1k now on good equipment.
- The smartest man I've every worked for was a Math PhD. I've learned so much from that guy. I hope he's doing well.
- Once, in high school, there was thing girl who was a great friend of mine. I mean we talked and hung out and shared a lot of personal stuff over a few years. Then there was a rumor that I liked her or that we were going out or whatever. She didn't take that too well so she started to ignore me. That didn't feel too good. I guess this would be the modern equivalent to "ghosting". I don't wish her any ill will though, and I hope she's doing great. I'm sorry I didn't handle that better.
- I had a girlfriend in 8th grade that I didn't want to break up with even though I didn't like her anymore so I just started to ignore her. That was so fucked up. I'm sorry, Lena.
- You know what the best part of being a software engineer is? You can meet and talk to people who think like you. Not necessarily the same interests like sports and TV shows and stuff. But they think about problems the same way you think of them. That's pretty cool.
- There's not enough women in technology. What a fucked up industry. That needs to change. I've been trying to be more encouraging and helpful to the women engineers in our org, but I don't know what else to do.
- Same with black engineers. What the hell?
- I've never really started hating a language or technology until I started becoming intimately familiar with it. Also, I think a piece of tech is good if I hate it but I simultaneously would recommend it to a client. Fuck Jenkins but man I don't think I would be commuting software malpractice by recommending it to a new client.
- That being said, git is awful and I have choice but to use it. Also, GUI git tools can go to hell, give me the command line any day. There's like 7 command lines to memorize, everything else can be googled.
- Since I work in data, I'm going to give a data-specific lessons learned. Fuck pandas.
- My job is easier because I have semi-technical analysts on my team. Semi-technical because they know programming but not software engineering. This is a blessing because if something doesn't make sense to them, it means that it was probably badly designed. I love the analysts on the team; they've helped me grow so much more than the most brilliant engineers.
- Dark mode is great until you're forced to use light mode (webpage or an unsupported app). That's why I use light mode.
- I know enough about security to know that I don't know shit about security.
- Crap I'm out of wine.
- Being a good engineer means knowing best practices. Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.
- If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it's time to move on.
- A lot of progressive companies, especially startups, talk about bringing your "authentic self". Well what if your authentic self is all about watching porn? Yeah, it's healthy to keep a barrier between your work and personal life.
- I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour. I'd rather spend time with kids, family, or friends.
- The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault. You better believe I would've walked over fire for her.
- On the same token, the best leaders I've been privileged to work under did their best to both advocate for my opinions and also explain to me other opinions 'that conflict with mine. I'm working hard to be like them.
- Fuck side projects. If you love doing them, great! Even if I had the time to do side-projects, I'm too damn busy writing drunken posts on reddit
- Algorithms and data strictures are important--to a point. I don't see pharmacist interviews test trivia about organic chemistry. There's something fucked with our industry's interview process.
- Damn, those devops guys and gals are f'ing smart. At least those mofos get paid though.
- It's not important to do what I like. It's more important to do what I don't hate.
- The closer I am to the product, the closer I am to driving revnue, the more I feel valued regardless of how technical my work is. This has been true for even the most progressive companies.
- Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows. Why? Because I eventually worked in Linux. So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.
- I've learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data. WTF is "big" data? I've dealt with 10k rows streaming every 10 minutes in Spark and Kafka and dealt with 1B rows batched up hourly in Python and MySQL. Those labels can go fuck themselves.
- Not all great jobs are in Silicon Valley. But a lot are.

Finally, if you really want to hurt me, don't downvote I don't care about that. Just ignore this post. Nothing makes me sadder than when I wrote a long post and then nobody responds. So if you hate this post, just ignore.

Oh shit I found beer: let's keeping going.

On programming languages

- I once hated a programming language (C#) until I started using it. Now I hated it but think it's useful.
- Then I started hating a programming language (C#) and left it and came back. Wow, that programming language has really improved.
- The greatest thing about functional languages is that functions are first class and all other programmers know that.
- No matter how great or superior a language is, it doesn't matter if people don't use it.
- Learning a language isn't hard. It's learning the ecosystem.

On coworkers

- Pair programming is great, it just takes a lot of time--time that the company usually doesn't want to spend.
- Working with smart engineers has made me a better coder. Working with smart non-technical co-workers has made me a better engineer.
- Don't spend time outside of the 9-5 working. Unless you want to because you got a banging project and you're in the groove. That shit is awesome.
- Happy hours and social hours across teams are 99% just chilling and getting to know coworkers. That's cool. Every once in a while, the 1% is about a critical project with a critical piece of code and you're glad you brought up work in a social setting because shit would've hit the fan otherwise. I'm not saying that I should hang out with other teams outside of work because of this. I just want to bond. But it sure as hell is a nice perk.

On working from home

- If the company is half remote and half on-site, it's important to determine if the remote people aren't treated as second-class citizens. If major decisions are made "at the water cooler", then it's better to try to change the company culture (hard) or move on to a different company that treats its remote employees as first class citizens.
- The second worst major downside of working from home is no whiteboard.
- The first major downside of working from home is that it's hard to learn from coworkers. Unless I'm (a) confident and assertive to ask questions and (b) the company has a culture where remote workers are equivelent to on-site workers, I think it was best that I worked on-side for the first 5 years of my career.

On technology

- Everyone knows that tech changes. The tech landscape of the past 10 years has changed dramatically. But fundamentals don't change very much, especially fundamentals that apply to my field.
- Hacker news and /r/programming is only good to get general ideas and keep up-to-date. The comments are almost worthless.
- There's a lot of vocal amateurs with strong opinions about technology. Even amateurs published on "respectable" journals and blogs. I found it to keep abreast of the rumors but to figure things out for myself.
- I work at a cutting edge startup and we don't use the latest XYZ tech that was present at ABC cutting edge tech company. And it turn out, what they usually present is only a small percentage of their engineering department and that most of them are using the same tech we are.
- That being said, it's important to read the signs. If you want to work with modern tech and you're company is still doing the majority of it's development in jQuery, might be time to re-evauluate.

On Data Engineering

- Fuck it I'm a data engineer so I might as well give more specific, target advice/experience
- SQL is king. Databases like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite is still supreme. Even if you work with new tech, most of it transfers anyway.
- Most companies aren't doing streaming. It's hard and complicated. If you're 10 years into your career and you don't know how to work with 10k records per second, don't worry about it, there's still jobs out for you.
- Airflow is shit, yes. There are other products out there, but fuck me if Airflow isn't the most widely used.
- Machine learning projects are highly prone to failure. They're complicated and hard to implement. Don't believe me? How easy is it to write fucking unit test a machine learning model? Yeah.
- Our field is new. There's no good book on data engineering, just go and "do it". Can't learn it through a bootcamp and shit. This will probably change in 10 years as we all figure out what the fuck we're doing.

On Life

- People die. Do you want your code to be your legacy? If yes, then spend a lot of time on it because that's your fucking legacy and you go! But if you are like me, your legacy is surrounded with family, friends, and people in your life and not the code you write. So don't get too hung up on it.
- Good people write shitty code. Smart people write shitty code. Good coders and good engineers write shitty code. Don't let code quality be a dependent variable on your self worth.
- I got into tech and coding because tech was my hobby. Now my hobby is is the same as work and work has ruined my hobby. So now if I want to enjoy tech I need to quit my hobby. Or I need to be OK that tech is no longer my hobby and find new hobbies.
- Programming and computer science is like, what, 80 years old? Compare that with any other engineering discipline. Yeah, we collectively don't know what the fuck we're doing.
- I'm making pretty good money. Be grateful and appreciate. Also, save.

Other shit

- I've built large platforms and libraries that are used by multiple teams and people for many years. Yet for some reason, the most proud I was of the code I wrote was the small script that was used by me.
- The proudest accomplishment of my career has been helping other people be better at their jobs. That's probably because I'm destined to be a people manager, so this is probably not helpful to other people.
- When I was looking for a job, I created an updated my Linkedin. I got shit replies and deleted it. Now I use Linkedin to find other candidates to join my company. Bottom line, Linkedin is a lot of noise. I only find it valuable because now, part of my job is contributing to that noise.
- Once, I found out in college that a girl liked me. I didn't believe it because I had poor self esteem, but then she asked me out. I told her I wasn't interested even though she was really cool. That was one of the proudest moments in my life because I as mature enough at 19 to say "no" in a mature way.
- /r/cscareerquestions is such a cesspool of ego and misinformation that I don't know what to do about it. Like, WTF. I want to shake all those people and try to explain to them how the world really is, but they wouldn't believe me.

On my general feelings right now

- I'm drunk and I usually don't drink, so I would think that everything I say is probably cringy or terrible
- I feel strongly that people should save and invest money. If you have a 6 figure salary, do your best to max our your 401k please.
- I've become what I've always hated: someone who works in tech in a career but avoid tech in real life. Maybe that comes with being old.
- /r/ExperiencedDevs is a pretty cool community. Thank you mods. You get way less appreciation than you deserve. Seriously, thank you.
- I probably owe my career, my salary, my life to Reddit. Reddit gets a lot of shit but the communities here have lifted me out of poverty (working at a gas station earning min wage) to learning Linux, SQL, python, C#, Python, and others to get me where I am.
- Kids are great. I don't have kids by choice. Why? Because I love kids and I'm scared about what kind of father I would be. Oh shit, is that too personal for a post here?
- Once, someone asked me who I looked up to and I said Conan O'brien, and they laughed at me. But I was being serous because on his last show on the Tonight Show, he told his audience to be kind and work hard. It happend during a difficult period of my life, and when I watched him say that, I said, you know what, I'm going to do just that. Because what would I have to lose? And you know what? I've met some brilliant people who I've learned from over 10+ years because I was kind to them. And I've grown a lot by working hard and not being afraid to try new things. And my life is infinitely, infinitely better because of those words. So yes, it might seem silly and even ridiculous to say that I've achieved a level of fulfillment in my life because of a late night talk show. But you know what, fuck it, it's my life and I will proudly say that I owe any success I've achieved because a fucking comic on late night television.

I'm highly intoxicated so please disregard anything I say. Also apologies for ranting.

- 你要做的就是自主、跨界、终身学习
- 公司不是唯一的目标 公司迟早会让你来承担成本，通过摆脱你来降低成本。
- 骡子只是施工队的工具，跟锄头或者扁担没有本质区别。但你不是他人的工具，你活着不是为了被动地被他人使用，而是应该要有自己的价值。我觉得，人应该过一种有乐趣、有追求、自己做主的生活，而不能像骡子那样被推着走。
- 正常情况下，明天其实会更糟，因为熵在累积，只有不断注入新的能量处理熵，明天才会更好。(能量注入，普通人生活更好了)
- 人类如同宇宙的其他事物一样，常态和最终命运一定是变得更混乱和无序。
- 转换的能量越大，创造出来的新状态就会越多。高能量系统不如低能量系统稳定，不仅因为前者更容易发生能量转换，还因为在转化过程中会创造出更多的状态（即更多的熵）。
- 如果不施加外力影响，事物永远向着更混乱的状态发展。
- 物理学告诉我们，没有办法消除熵和混乱，我们只是让某些局部变得更有秩序，把混乱转移到另一些领域。
